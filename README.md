- WebSocket connections to track new tokens
- Multiple data source integration (pump.fun, etc.)

### Security Analysis
- Comprehensive security checks for tokens
- Mint/freeze authority verification
- Liquidity pattern analysis
- Honeypot detection simulation

### Educational Simulation
- Simulated trading decisions based on analysis
- Portfolio tracking with virtual SOL
- Risk management demonstration
- Performance metrics calculation

### Interactive Dashboard
- Real-time web dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`
- Portfolio overview and statistics
- Active position monitoring
- Trade history visualization

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone or extract the project
cd solana-sniper-bot

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the educational analyzer
npm run dev
```

### Usage

1. **Start the system**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open dashboard**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Monitor activity**: Watch as the system detects and analyzes tokens

4. **Review results**: Observe simulated trading decisions and portfolio changes

## üìä Dashboard Features

- **Security Analysis**: View token safety assessments
- **System Status**: Monitor analyzer health and activity

## üîß Configuration

Edit `.env` file to customize:

```env
# Analysis parameters
MIN_LIQUIDITY_SOL=1              # Minimum liquidity threshold
MIN_CONFIDENCE_SCORE=70          # Minimum security score
MAX_ANALYSIS_AGE_MS=30000        # Token age limit (30 seconds)

# Simulation parameters  
SIMULATED_INVESTMENT=0.03        # Simulated investment per token
MAX_SIMULATED_POSITIONS=25       # Maximum concurrent positions

# Dashboard
DASHBOARD_PORT=3000              # Web interface port
LOG_LEVEL=info                   # Logging verbosity
```

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This tool demonstrates:

1. **Blockchain Monitoring**: How to track on-chain activity
2. **Security Analysis**: Token safety evaluation techniques  
3. **Risk Management**: Position sizing and stop-loss concepts
4. **Performance Tracking**: Portfolio metrics and analysis
5. **System Architecture**: Event-driven trading system design

## üìö Educational Use Cases

- **Cryptocurrency Education**: Understanding token analysis
- **Trading Strategy Learning**: Risk management concepts
- **Blockchain Development**: Solana ecosystem exploration
- **Portfolio Management**: Tracking and metrics
- **System Design**: Event-driven architecture patterns

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Hardcoded DRY_RUN Mode**: Cannot execute real trades
- **Simulation Only**: All activities are educational simulations
- **No Private Keys**: No wallet connections required
- **No Real Funds**: Uses virtual SOL for demonstrations
- **Educational Warnings**: Clear indicators throughout interface

## üîç Security Analysis Components

The system analyzes tokens for:

- **Mint Authority**: Whether minting is disabled
- **Freeze Authority**: Whether freezing is disabled  
- **Supply Analysis**: Token supply characteristics
- **Liquidity Patterns**: DEX liquidity evaluation
- **Honeypot Detection**: Suspicious contract patterns
- **Metadata Verification**: Token information validation

## üìà Simulation Engine

The dry-run engine simulates:

- **Entry Decisions**: Based on security analysis scores
- **Position Sizing**: Dynamic investment amounts
- **Exit Strategies**: Stop-loss and take-profit rules
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Balance and P&L calculation
- **Risk Management**: Position limits and diversification

## üéÆ Demo Mode

The system includes a demo mode that:
